==================

A collection of two dimensional animations that are triggered by sound.

Prototyped with [Processing](http://processing.org/), built with [JavaScript](http://jonobr1.github.com/two.js).

Added bpm input. Will respond to live bpm changes when recording a loop. Must change focus (click on screen) from input for this change to register.

Sequencing comes from [WAAClock](https://github.com/sebpiq/WAAClock) from [sebpiq](https://github.com/sebpiq).

Uses the [duloop.js](https://github.com/albinotonnina/Neuronal-Synchrony/commit/e4f4268f0d187ae76f31dc73470c3a38aca86ca1)
from  [albinotonnina](https://github.com/albinotonnina) to trigger the graphics.
